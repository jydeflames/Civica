# 🗳️ Civica — Decentralized Web3 Voting Platform

Civica is a decentralized voting platform designed for the next generation of governance. Built on blockchain technology, Civica enables **secure, transparent, anonymous**, and **tamper-proof** voting experiences across a wide range of use cases—from organizational decision-making to public elections.

By leveraging smart contracts and decentralized identity systems, Civica empowers communities, DAOs, institutions, and governments to facilitate trustworthy digital voting on the Ethereum blockchain and other EVM-compatible networks.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **🛡️ Security**: Votes are cryptographically signed and securely stored on-chain.
- **🕵️ Anonymity**: Voter identities are protected through zero-knowledge proofs or anonymous credential systems.
- **📜 Transparency**: All votes are publicly verifiable and auditable without compromising voter privacy.
- **🧾 Immutability**: Once recorded, votes cannot be altered or removed.
- **⛓️ Blockchain Agnostic**: Deployed on Ethereum, with multi-chain support (e.g., Polygon, BNB Chain) to ensure scalability and accessibility.
- **🧠 Smart Contracts**: Fully autonomous, trustless elections using audited smart contracts.
- **🌍 Open Governance**: Designed for DAOs, political elections, board decisions, and community polls.

## 📦 Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: A user-friendly DApp (React.js + Web3.js / Ethers.js) that allows users to create, join, and participate in elections.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based contracts managing election creation, voting logic, and result finalization.
- **Backend (Optional)**: IPFS or decentralized storage (e.g., Filecoin) for hosting metadata like candidate details.
- **Identity Layer**: Integrates with decentralized identity (DID) protocols and optionally uses zk-SNARKs for private verification.
- **Multisig Admin Panel**: Governance over election rules and deployment parameters through multisig wallets (e.g., Gnosis Safe).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Hardhat or Truffle
- Metamask or WalletConnect
- Ganache (for local testing)
- IPFS node (optional)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/civica.git
cd civica
npm install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the DApp.

## 🔐 Smart Contract Highlights

- `ElectionFactory.sol`: Deploys and registers new elections
- `Election.sol`: Manages vote casting, result computation, and finalization
- `Verifier.sol`: Handles zero-knowledge proof validation (optional module)
- `VoterRegistry.sol`: Manages whitelist or public voter eligibility

Contracts follow OpenZeppelin best practices for upgradeability and security.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- Ethereum / Solidity
- React / Next.js / Ethers.js
- IPFS / Filecoin
- zk-SNARKs (via circom/snarkjs)
- ENS (for human-readable election URLs)
- Gnosis Safe (governance & permissions)
